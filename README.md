 RESUME EXERCISE:


First we are going to see what's going on with the data: We realize that there are a few variables, all of them are correct on data type. I suggest to change the name of the column: "Life expectancy at birth (years)", is too long and it could take you a wrong code in the future..., but I use copy/paste and i get assure that the calling column will not have an error.

I print a figure with the different GDP that those countries had in order to visualice how are they positioned, and I realice that the is according to the richest country they are; we can see that is two easy to understand that there is a strong correlation variables on the GDP with the life expentancy at birth in years; USA is on TOP! on GDP and also on Life expectancy at birth (years) as we can imaging.

On next figures we get different figures in order to see the behavior one the relationship between the GDP vs life expentancy at birth per country; the country that we were compared they have, more or less, the same trend on the curve, ascending the value GDP  as the year expentancy life increment.

We can also realize that Zimbabwe is getting richer year to year and has a correlation with the Life expectancy at birth (years), it has the steeper curve from the others countries that we are comparing.

There is a similar Life expectancy at birth (years) (3-4 years different)  on all the countries except the poorest one (Zimbabwe).

Decisions’clue:

That study gives an important information for the governments  and their economical politics decisions, the optimistic message they should give to the population lifes and the importance of taking care about the heath’s population.
